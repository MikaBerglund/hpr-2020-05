Microsoft 365 HPR Seminar, May 5-6, 2020
========================================

This repository contains all material for my presentation "Office 365- ja Azure-palveluiden yhdistäminen". The presentation is in Finnish, but I've kept the source code and its documentation in English to get a broader audience.


Applications
------------

This repository contains the following applications as sample code.

- **HprApi** - An Azure Functions application that is used as an API by many of the Logic Apps in this presentation. If you want to run this in your own environment, you need to specify the required configuration information. For details see [`local.settings.json.md`](./HprApi/local.settings.json.md)
- **HprWeb** - A Web Application that is used to integrate with the services presented in the presentation. To run this application in your own environment, you need to specify the necessary configuration information. For details, see [`appsettings.local.json.md`](./HprWeb/appsettings.local.json.md)
